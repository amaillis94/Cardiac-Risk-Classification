### Currently in progress, working on a multi-classification model to predict cardiac risk of a patient entering the ED based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) results and prior medical history (if available). Improved risk stratification for patients entering the ED would help prioritize clinician review, efficiently allocate beds, and improve patient outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndromes.
